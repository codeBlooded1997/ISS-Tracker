# ISS-Tracker


This is a quick project I build up to explore some REST APIs and learn more about them by building projects.
I haven't spend so much time on the interface and this is a command line application and I will print the data that is being updated in the temrinal.

Python's turtle package was the best option for this project (In my opinion).
I've played with it before when I was trying to learn what is interactinve programming but in this project I learned how to use it for visualizing some real time data and actually be able to render the data while it was updating.

The code is fully commentet out so, feel free to use it for educatial purposes.

# In this project I learned:
    - Using open-notify API to get real time data from NASA.
    - Using turtle package for visulizing real time data that I got from REST API.
    - Using external files in turtle package window.
    - Using latitude and longitute and google maps api to visualize the geographical location for ISS.

# For running the script:
    - Open the terminal and navigae to directory where the project folder exists.
    - run the command:
        python iss_tracker.py
